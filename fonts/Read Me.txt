Open *demo.html* to see a list of all the glyphs in your fon
t along with their codes/ligatures.


You won't need any of the files located under the *
demo-files* directory when including the generated fon
t in your own projects.

You can import *selection.json*\\

 back to the IcoMoon app using the *Import Icons* button 
(or via Main Menu > Manage Projects) to retrieve your icon 
selection.
